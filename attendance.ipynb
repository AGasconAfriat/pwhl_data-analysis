    "# PWHL Attendance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "As women’s sports gain popularity, I am interested in the evolution of game attendance over time. I am particularly interested in the case of the Professional Women’s Hockey League (PWHL).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "I had the chance to witness the Montreal Victoire’s first home game, on January 13, 2024. The team did not have a name yet and was simply referred to as \"PWHL Montreal\". The game was held at the Verdun auditorium, the 4114-seat venue where the Victoire trains. The ambiance was amazing.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Victoire still trains in Verdun, the team now holds all of its regular home matches in a bigger venue, Place Bell, which can accomodate 10,062 spectators.\n",
    "\n",
    "As women’s hockey gains popularity and athletes are getting paid full-time salaries to train together, we are seeing a higher level of play than ever before. I hope the attendance numbers will be maintained over time or even grow, ensuring the PWHL’s future and setting an example which, I hope, will lead to better funding for women’s sports and high level female athletes flourishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data source\n",
    "\n",
    "The PWHL’s website’s [schedule page](https://www.thepwhl.com/en/stats/schedule/all-teams/5/all-months) lists all games for the current season in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "![the top of a table titled Schedule and listing the date, time, teams, scores, venues and broadcasters for PWHL games](./img/2025-04-07_ScheduleTable.png)"

    "\n",
    "It is therefore possible to use the webpage to get a list of URLs corresponding to game reports for all of a season’s games. Then, information can be collected from each of the reports, which appear to all be formatted in the same way."
